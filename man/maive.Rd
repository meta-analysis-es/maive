\usage{
maive(
  dat = dat,
  method = method,
  weight = weight,
  instrument = instrument,
  studylevel = studylevel,
  AR = AR
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{dataframe with columns bs, sebs, Ns, study_id (optional)}

\item{method}{1=FAT-PET, 2=PEESE, 3=PET-PEESE, 4=EK}

\item{AR}{Anderson Rubin corrected confidence interval for weak instruments (only for unweighted MAIVE versions of PET, PEESE and PET-PEESE, not available for fixed effects): 0=no, 1=yes

standard estimator: same option as for MAIVE but weighted by inverse variance and not instrumented}

\item{weighting}{0=no weights, 1=standard weights, 2=adjusted weights}

\item{instrumenting}{1=yes, 0=no}

\item{correlation}{correlation at study level: 0=none, 1=fixed effects, 2=cluster}
}
\value{
$beta = MAIVE meta-estimate

$SE MAIVE standard error

$beta_standard = meta-estimate as chosen by option

$SE_standard standard error as chosen by option

$Hausman Hausman type test: comparison between MAIVE and standard version

$F-Test heteroskedastic robust F-test of the first step instrumented standard errors (when instrumenting)

$AR-CI Anderson-Rubin confidence interval for weak instruments

$SE_instrumented instrumented standard errors
